Project Title: Next-Generation WAF: A Detailed Architecture
Introduction:
This document details the architectural design for a next-generation Web Application Firewall (WAF) system, leveraging a combination of industry-standard and advanced security tools. The architecture is built upon a multi-layered defense strategy, ensuring that traffic is inspected and filtered at multiple points before reaching the core web application.

The design incorporates a reverse proxy, a WAF engine, a network-level IDS/IPS, a host-based firewall, and a robust monitoring system to create a resilient and proactive security posture.
Architectural Components and Their Roles
1. Nginx Reverse Proxy

Nginx serves as the primary entry point for all incoming web traffic. Its role is twofold:

    Traffic Forwarding: It acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding legitimate requests to the backend web server. This provides a single, controlled point of access to the application.

    Initial Defense Layer: By standing between the internet and the application, Nginx shields the web server's direct IP address, mitigating a significant number of direct attacks.

2. ModSecurity on Nginx (WAF Engine)

ModSecurity is the core Web Application Firewall engine. It is integrated directly into the Nginx server as a module, allowing it to inspect HTTP/HTTPS traffic at the application layer.

    Application-Layer Inspection: ModSecurity analyzes the contents of each request body and header. Using its powerful rule sets (such as the OWASP Core Rule Set), it can detect and block attacks that target web applications specifically, including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Remote File Inclusion.

    Real-Time Blocking: If a request violates a defined rule, ModSecurity can immediately block it and log the event, preventing the malicious payload from ever reaching the web server.

3. Suricata IDS/IPS

Suricata operates as a separate, powerful Intrusion Detection and Prevention System. It can be deployed in a variety of configurations (e.g., on a separate gateway or on the web server itself) to perform deep packet inspection.

    Network-Level Analysis: Suricata provides an additional layer of security by analyzing network traffic at a lower level than ModSecurity. It can detect a broader range of threats, including network-based attacks, port scans, and malicious payloads embedded in protocols beyond HTTP.

    IDS (Intrusion Detection System) Mode: In IDS mode, Suricata will log and alert on suspicious activity, providing valuable forensic data.

    IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) Mode: Configured in IPS mode, Suricata can actively drop malicious packets, preventing them from reaching their destination. This serves as a critical fail-safe layer in the event a threat bypasses the WAF.

4. Iptables (Stateful Inspection Firewall)

Iptables is a host-based firewall running on the web server itself. It acts as the final and most restrictive line of defense, enforcing a principle of least privilege.

    Source-Based Filtering: The iptables rules are configured for stateful inspection, meaning they track the state of connections. Crucially, the rules are set to only accept inbound traffic that originates from the trusted IP address of the Nginx proxy.

    Complete Isolation: This configuration ensures that no traffic from the public internet can directly reach the web server, effectively isolating it and making it impossible for an attacker to bypass the Nginx proxy and WAF layers.

5. Nagios Monitoring System

Nagios is the central nervous system for monitoring the health and availability of all components.

    Component Health Checks: Nagios continuously monitors the status of the Nginx server, the web server, and the associated services. It can check if a service is running, if a port is open, or if a critical resource (CPU, memory) is over-utilized.

    Proactive Alerting: When a component goes down or an anomaly is detected (e.g., a sudden spike in CPU usage on the Nginx server), Nagios sends immediate alerts to administrators, enabling a swift response.

    Security Event Correlation: While Nagios is not a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, it can be configured to monitor log files from ModSecurity and Suricata, providing an extra layer of visibility into potential security incidents.

Traffic Flow and Layered Defense

The traffic path through the system is a multi-step, layered process:

    Internet Traffic arrives at the Nginx Reverse Proxy.

    The ModSecurity WAF inspects the HTTP request within Nginx. If it is malicious, the request is blocked.

    If the request passes the WAF, it is forwarded to the web server's IP address.

    The Suricata IDS/IPS inspects the network packets. If malicious, it can drop them.

    The Iptables Firewall on the web server checks if the traffic source is the trusted Nginx proxy. If it is not, the connection is dropped.

    If all checks pass, the request reaches the Web Application.

Throughout this entire process, Nagios provides constant monitoring and alerting.
Conclusion:

This architecture creates a powerful, multi-layered security solution. By combining the application-layer intelligence of ModSecurity, the network-level deep inspection of Suricata, the host-based isolation of iptables, and the robust monitoring of Nagios, the system provides a comprehensive and proactive defense against both known and unknown threats. This setup ensures that the web application is protected from multiple vectors of attack, providing a high level of security and reliability.
